using phillip's script, every even value has two entries. ie .02, .04 happen twice sequentially.

the header values, taking vals[2] - vals[0] shows an incrementing value, always between 154-166
tried checking the value @ the difference value (ie difference = 2e, check position 2e) could not find correlation
